Repository for DSA Datathon

GW Data Science Association Spring Datathon Guidelines

1. Dates:
● GitHub Repository with the Report due at 5 PM on Thursday, March 30th<br>
● In-Person Presentation on Saturday, April 1st at 11 AM<br>
● Attend Data Science Week events to earn bonus points. Each team/participant can
receive up to 10 bonus points and you can find information about location and
times on our instagram @gwu_dsa<br>
○ Trivia Night (March 27, 2023): +2 points<br>
○ Data Science Working Session (March 28, 2023): +3 points<br>
■ Please Read: This time is provided for you to meet with your
group as well as asking questions about setup/deliverables. We
encourage you to come to this working session because we will
have a professor there to assist you.<br>

○ Game Night & Networking (March 29, 2023): +3 points<br>
○ DSA Logo Competition (March 30, 2023): +2 points<br>

2. Data:
You can access the dataset for Datathon at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability?resource=download)
3. Problem Statement:
● We are interested in identifying, understanding, and predicting the drinkability of
water based on its features. Your task is:<br>
○ To identify pattern, and show how different water qualities may be related
○ Build a model that predicts drinkability of water when the qualities change
● Please cite any additional research done to support your conclusion
4. Report:
The report, in the form of Jupyter notebook or Google Collab, should include the
following sections:
● Abstract: Summarize the key findings
● Pipeline: Implement the full pipeline of the project, including:
○ Data cleaning/preprocessing
○ EDA
○ Hyperparameter tuning and / or model selection
○ Interpretation: e. g., feature’s predictive power over the target
○ Discussion/ Conclusion

5. Presentation:
● Prepare a 5-10 minute long presentation, which should include a focus on the
interpretation and a discussion of the report
● PowerPoint Presentation
○ The slides can include data cleaning and preprocessing steps, feature
engineering, EDA, and modeling, etc.
○ Highlight any interesting patterns and insights
○ Explain why you chose the model and the steps you took to increasing its
performance
○ Make sure to not exeed the time limit

6. Deliverables:
● Each team should submit a Jupyter notebook or Google Collab file and include:
○ The GitHub Repo link of the report
○ Submission should be emailed to arugupta17@gwu.edu by 5 PM on
Thursday, March 30th

7. Judging Criteria:
○ On top of evaluating the GitHub Repository organization and the in-person
presentation the rubric below is also how the judges will evaluate each team/
participant:
Categories 4-Excellent 3- Good 2-Acceptable 1-Needs
Improvement

Data Cleaning
/Preprocessing

Techniques used are
effective and well
throughtout to not
remove important
information

Most of the data is
cleaned and
preprocessed

Better data cleaning
techniques could
have been used

No data cleaning or
preprocessing was
done

Visualizations Visuals tell the story
about the data and
are appropriately
chosen

Visuals partially
describe the data

Visuals don’t fully
describe and are not
the best chose

Visuals are not
related to data at all

Models The appropriate
model is chosen and
participants
maximized its
potential

Participants seem
mostly
knowledgeable on
why they chose the
model and have
used it correctly

Model chosen may
not have the best
one but one was
implemented

No modeling was
attempted.

Analysis A thorough
discussion about the
findings and the
impact it can create

A brief discussion
about the findings
but limited analysis
on how they are
helpful

Minor discussion
but lacks clarity and
effort

Results were simply
stated.

8. Prizes
● Prize money will be awarded to the top 3 highest scoring teams with the 1st team
to win $300, 2nd team to win $200 and the 3rd team to win $100.
